## Features
- Unary Operation functionality which offers unary operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.
- Binary Operation functionality which offers binary operations.
- Store calculated results in the memory using memory keys.
- Use the previous calculated result by pressing the Ans button or 'A' key on your keyboard.
- Precise results for arithmetic operations so that calculations never lose on precision.

## Getting Started
-  To Perform a Binary Operation

    1.  Input first operand by clicking on the numpad or through keyboard key press.
    2.  Input operation that need to be performed (For binary operation the calculator will display the first operand and operator in a label).
